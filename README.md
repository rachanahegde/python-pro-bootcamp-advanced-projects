<h1> Advanced Projects from the 100 Days of Code Python Pro Bootcamp </h1>

<h2> Day 59: Blog Capstone Project Part 2 - Adding Styling </h2>
Using Jinja, Flask, and Bootstrap, I built a multi-page blog website with an interactive navigation bar and dynamically generated blog post pages with full screen titles. It's also fully mobile responsive with an adaptive navigation bar.

<h2> Day 60: Making POST Requests with Flask and HTML Forms </h2>
I learned about how HTML forms work and how to email myself the form submitted by a user on my blog website.

<h2> Day 61: Building Advanced Forms with Flask-WTForms </h2>
I learned to build forms on my website using a Flask extension called Flask-WTF and Flask-Bootstrap.

<h2> Day 62: Coffee & Wifi Project </h2>
I used Flask, WTForms, Bootstrap and CSV to build the backend for a website that features a database of cafes with information on wifi speed, coffee quality, etc.

<h2> Day 63: Creating a Virtual Bookshelf </h2>
I built a virtual bookshelf by learning how to create an SQLite database and how to create, read, update and delete data in the database. I connected this database to my Flask website to serve data when needed.

<h2> Day 64: My Top 10 Movies Website </h2>
I built a top 10 movies website using Flask, WTForms, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy. It lists my top 10 films and I can update it to keep track of  which movies to recommend people.

<h2> Day 71: Data Exploration with Pandas: College Major v.s. Your Salary </h2>
This project involved learning about data exploration with Pandas by analysing the post-university salaries of graduates by major. Topics covered include cleaning data, selecting columns/rows/cells, sorting data and grouping data by category.

<h2> Day 72: Data Visualisation with Matplotlib: Programming Languages </h2>
This project involved analysing the popularity of different programming languages over time using the tags on Stack Overflow posts. During this project I learned about visualising data and creating charts with Matplotlib, how to pivot, group and manipulate my data with Pandas, working with timestamps and time-series data, and how to style and customise a line chart.

<h2> Day 73: Aggregate & Merge Data with Pandas: Analyse the LEGO Dataset </h2>
I analysed a dataset of LEGO Pieces. During this process, I learned about combining a Notebook with HTML Markup, applying Python list slicing techniques to Pandas DataFrames, aggregating data, creating scatter plots, bar charts, and line charts with two axes in Matplotlib. I also studied  database schemas organised by primary and foreign keys as well as merging DataFrames that share a common key.
